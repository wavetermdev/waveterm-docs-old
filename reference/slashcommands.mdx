Welcome to our Slash Command Reference Guide, a comprehensive resource designed to streamline your workflow in Wave using intuitive commands.
Here, you'll find detailed explanations on how to manage various settings and configurations in Wave related to sessions and windows, client settings, editing and viewing files inline, and much more.

## /bookmark

Commands that allow you to set and delete single bookmarks.

### /bookmark:delete

Remove a bookmark.

### /bookmark:set

Add a bookmark.

## /bookmarks

Commands that allow you to manage multiple bookmarks.

### /bookmarks:show

Show all bookmarks.

## /chat
Ask the AI-assistant an [ad-hoc] question from the terminal.

```
/chat How do I resolve a merge conflict?
```
<Tip>
For interactive sessions, use the "Wave AI" button in the command box, or use the shortcut `ctrl + space
</Tip>

## /clear

Clear all commands from the current window.

```
Usage:
/clear
```

## /client

Commands that allow you to change and show client settings and information.

### /client:set

Update client settings.

```
Usage:
/client:set [termfontsize=fontsize] [termfontfamily=fontfamily] [openaiapitoken=token] [openaimodel=modelname] [openaibaseurl=url] [openaimaxtokens=tokens] [openaimaxchoices=choices]
```
Options:
- `termfontsize` - Update the font size used in the terminal. You can set the font size from 8 to 15 pixels (px).
- `termfontfamily` - Update the font family used in the terminal. Wave supports *JetBrains Mono*, *Hack*, and *Fira Code* out of the box. You can also use any fixed-width font installed on your local machine by specifying its exact name. Be cautious when setting a custom font, as mistyping the font name or using a non-fixed-width font may result in visual inconsistencies.
- `openaiapitoken` - Set your OpenAI API token to use the OpenAI API directly instead of the Wave cloud servers.
- `openaimodel` - Choose the OpenAI language model to use for generating responses. Default is *gpt-3.5-turbo*.
- `openaibaseurl` - Set the base URL for the OpenAI API if you want to use a different endpoint or a third-party API compatible with the OpenAI API.
- `openaimaxtokens` - Set the maximum number of tokens to use when generating a response from the OpenAI API. Note that this option is only effective when using your own API token. If you're using Wave's proxy, the maxtokens value is preconfigured.
- `openaimaxchoices` -  Specify the maximum number of choices to generate when using the OpenAI API. Note that this option only applies when using your own API token. If you're using Wave's proxy, this value is predetermined.

**Note:** The `openaimaxtokens` and `openaimaxchoices` options are only applicable when using your own OpenAI API token. If you're using Wave's built-in proxy for API requests, these values are predetermined to ensure optimal performance and compatibility.

### /client:show

This command displays various client settings and version information. It includes read-only values found in the client, settings made by the user in the UI, as well as settings set using the [/client:set](#client-set) command.

## /codeedit

View and edit files inline using rich native UI. Includes syntax highlighting, code folding, and completion.

```
Usage:
/codeedit [filename]

The option `filename` resolves against the current remote and current working directory.

Shortcuts:

**Note:** Codeedit also includes a live preview feature for Markdown files. To activate, open a Markdown file in Codeedit and click the `show preview` button located in the top right corner. This feature enables simultaneous editing and rendering, offering a side-by-side view of your Markdown source and its live output for efficient and immediate feedback.

<Tip>
See [codeview](#codeview) to view files in a _view only_ mode using the same native UI.
