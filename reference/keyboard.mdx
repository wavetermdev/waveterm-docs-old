title: Keyboard Shortcuts

Most of Wave's global keyboard shortcuts use Cmd/Alt because we generally try to reserve the Ctrl key for interacting with terminal commands directly or for system shortcuts like Copy, Paste, Select All, etc.  The shortcuts listed in the chart below are for MacOS.  Linux/Windows keybindings use `Alt` in place of `Cmd`.
